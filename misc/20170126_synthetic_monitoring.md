### Synthetic monitoring

`Synthetic monitoring` (also called `semantic monitoring`) runs a subset of an application's automated tests against the live production system on a regular basis. The results are pushed into the monitoring service, which triggers alerts in case of failures. This technique combines automated testing with monitoring in order to detect failing business requirements in production.
