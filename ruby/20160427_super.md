### super

The way `super` handles arguments is as follows:

* Called with no argument list, `super` automatically forwards the arguments that were passed to the method from which it's called.
* Called with an empty argument list - `super()` - `super` sends no arguments to the higher-up method, even if arguments were passed to the current method.
* Called with specific arguments - `super(a,b,c)` - `super` sends exactly these arguments.

```ruby
class A
  def foo(a="bar")
    puts "foo#{a}"
  end

  def pika(a="chu")
    puts "pika#{a}"
  end

  def ilove(a="you")
    puts "I love #{a}"
  end
end

class B < A
  def foo(b)
    super
  end

  def pika(b)
    super()
  end

  def ilove(b)
    super("her")
  end
end

B.new.foo('car') # => 'foocar'
B.new.pika('pika') # => 'pikachu'
B.new.ilove('myself') # => 'I love her'
```
