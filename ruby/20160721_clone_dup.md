### clone vs dup

* `clone` copies the singleton class/methods, while `dup` does not
    ```ruby
    o = Object.new
    def o.foo
      42
    end

    o.dup.foo   # raise NoMethodError
    o.clone.foo # returns 42
    ```
* `clone` preserves the frozen state. `dup` does not
    ```ruby
    class Foo
      attr_accessor :bar
    end

    o = Foo.new
    o.freeze

    o.dup.bar = 10    # succeeds
    o.clone.bar = 10  # raises RuntimeError
    ```

__Caution__: Subclasses may override these methods to provide different semantics. For example, in `ActiveRecord` `dup` will create a new object without its id, while `clone` creates a new object with the same id with the cloned one, so all the changes made to that new object will overwrite to the original record if hitting `save`.
