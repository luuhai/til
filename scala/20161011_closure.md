### Closure

* A function literal with no free variables, such as `(x: Int) => x + 1`, is called a `closed term`, where a `term` is a bit of source code.
* Otherwise, a function literal with free variables, such as `(x: Int) => x + more`, is an `open term`. Any function value created at runtime from this function literal will require that a binding for its free variable be captured. The resulting function value, which will contain a reference to the captured variable, is called a `closure` because the function value is the end product of the act of closing the open term.
* Scala's closures capture variables themselves, not the value to which variables refer, so they will know if the variables change.

    ```scala
    var more = 1
    val addMore = (x: Int) => x + more
    addMore(10) // => 11
    more = 2
    addmore(10) // => 12
    ```

* The same is true in the opposite direction. Changes made by a closure to a captured variable are visible outside the closure.

    ```scala
    var sum = 0
    val someNumbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
    someNumbers.foreach(sum += _)
    sum // => 10
    ```

* If a closure accesses some variables that has several different copies as the program runs, the instance used is the one that was active at the time the closure was created.

    ```scala
    def makeIncreaser(more: Int) = (x: Int) => x + more
    val inc1 = makeIncreaser(1)
    val inc10 = makeIncreaser(1)
    inc1(1) // => 2
    inc10(1) // => 11
    ```
