### Slicing in Python

```
[a,b,c]

len = length of string, tuple or list

c -- default is  +1. sign of c indicates forward or backward, absolute value of c indicates steps. Default is forward with step size 1. Positive means forward, negative means backward.

a --  when c is positive or blank, default is 0. when c is negative, default is -1.

b --  when c is positive or blank, default is len. when c is negative, default is -(len+1).
```

Note: If `a` and `b` are equal, then you'll get an empty list.
